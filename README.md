NECL is a meta-strategy to improve several state-of-the-art network embedding algorithms, such as DeepWalk, and Node2vec.


This code run with Python 3.

Graph, Classify and Node2vec code are improted from Openne project (https://github.com/thunlp/OpenNE) and we did some changings on them as needed
