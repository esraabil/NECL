# NECL
Network Embedding: ON compression and Learning

Code for  paper "HARP: Network Embedding: ON compression and Learning". NECL is a meta-strategy to improve several state-of-the-art network embedding algorithms, such as DeepWalk, and Node2vec.

You can read the preprint of our paper on Arxiv.

This code run with Python 3.

Graph, Classify and Node2vec code are improted from Openne project (https://github.com/thunlp/OpenNE) and we did some changings on them as needed
